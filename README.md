# BagelHacks2025

## Inspiration

Alexis' experience working a terribly tedious HR job. We set on to build our interpretation of this [Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/4fmtml/make_an_app_called_resume_roulette_people_submit/)

## What it does
### Don't buy ads, buy leads!

It's a platform for hiring organizations and job seekers that makes the most out of HR teams' work. Feedback on why a decision was made on an applicant is made visible to other interested recruiters and to the concerned applicant through an AI summarizing tool. It saves TIME for HR teams and applicants like getting feedback.

## How we built it

It's a web project:
- Frontend built with React/Next/Vite
- Backend built with Flask
- Database from MongoDB
- AI search powered by Cohere Rerank

## Challenges we ran into

- Syncing the database with the backend was harder than expected
- We thought React made sense...

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Brainstorming was pretty slow at first, but it got better and better as we went. We learned how to make the most of our idea, and refined it so we could really address a specific issue and got to formulate our solution as simply as possible.
We're proud that we are solving a real-life problem that we all have experienced first-hand on the job market. We are putting an end to ghost jobs!

## What we learned

- Collaboration!
- Modern front- and backend frameworks
- AI-powered search
